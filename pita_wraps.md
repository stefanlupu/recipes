### Ingredients:

* 7g dry yeast
* 5g || 1 teaspoon honey/sugar
* 300ml warm water (35-45C)
* 600g strong bread flour
* 15ml || 1 teaspoon olive oil
* 5g salt

### Instructions:

1. Activate the yeast by mixing it with 150ml || half of the warm water with the honey and let it sit until it becomes frothy (approx 5-10m).
2. Add the flour, rest of the water, olive oil and salt to the yeast mixture and stir until a soft dough forms.
3. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic.
4. Let it rest in a bowl covered with a damp cloth until doubled in size (approx 1-2h).
5. Once risen punch down the dough and divide it in equal parts (approx 6-8 pieces).
6. Roll each portion into a ball then flatten them to desired thickness using a rolling pin.
7. Let the pitas rise for a second time (approx 20-30m).
8. Heat a non-stick pan over medium-high heat and cook each pita one at a time until bubbles form, expand and char.
9. Immediately place the pitas in a clean cloth once removed from the pan to keep them soft and warm.
